This commit includes the complete K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning practical.

Contents:
- Heart disease dataset (heart.csv)
- KNN implementation using Scikit-Learn library
- Manual KNN implementation without library
- Accuracy vs K-value graph visualization
- Practical report in PDF format
- README documentation

This project demonstrates understanding of KNN algorithm, distance calculation, model training, prediction, and performance evaluation.
