##  Aim
To implement and evaluate the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification using Python.

##  Dataset
- Heart Disease Dataset (heart.csv)
- Used to predict whether a person has heart disease or not.

##  Algorithm Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm
- Distance-based classification technique

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Import required libraries
2. Load and explore dataset
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train KNN classifier
5. Make predictions
6. Evaluate using:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
7. Plot Accuracy
